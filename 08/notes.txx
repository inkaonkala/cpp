STL containers, iterators, algorithms

Use <algorithm>
exmpl:
 - std::sort
 - std::reverse
 - std::accumulate
 - std::find

-Function templates need to be defined in the header file or in a .tpp file 
because templates are not compiled untill they are instantiated.

std::stack

	

	queueue = first in first out FIFO, like book pile

	stack = last in first out LIFO, like jono
